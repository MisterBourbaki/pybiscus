# Pybiscus: a flexible Federated Learning Framework

## Get started

Pybiscus is a simple tool to perform Federated Learning on various models and datasets. 
It aims at automated as much as possible the FL pipeline, and allows to add virtually any kind of dataset and model.

Pybiscus is built on top of Flower, a mature Federated Learning framework; Typer (script and CLI parts) and Lightning/Fabric for all the Machine Learning machinery.

You can simply test Pybiscus by downloading the latest wheel available and install it.
